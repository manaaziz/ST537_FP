# ST537 Final Project

### Introduction
For this project we will be assessing the accuracy of various machine learning techniques when faced with predicting hotel cancellations. Essentially, these machine learning models will be attempting to classify a given hotel booking as either canceled or not canceled.

### Required Libraries
To run the code for the project, the following libraries are required:

  * `caret`: to do the heavy lifting of training and tuning the models
  * `tidyverse`: for all the data reading and wrangling
  * `knitr`: for rmarkdown table outputs
  * `rmarkdown`: for output documents
  * `randomForest`: fitting random forest models
  * `kernlab`: fitting the support vector machine
  * `class`: fitting the k-nearest neighbor model
